## 1. Introduction to Testing

### Importance of Testing
**Description**: Testing is a critical part of software development that ensures the quality and reliability of the software. It helps identify bugs and issues early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later. Testing also ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and provides a good user experience.

**Lab Activity**:
1. **Discussion**: Have a group discussion on the importance of testing in software development. Share real-world examples where lack of testing led to significant issues.
2. **Case Study**: Analyze a case study of a software failure due to inadequate testing. Discuss what went wrong and how proper testing could have prevented the issue.

### Types of Testing
**Description**: There are various types of testing, each serving a different purpose:
- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components or functions of the software.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different modules or services work well together.
- **Functional Testing**: Verifies that the software functions as expected according to the requirements.
- **System Testing**: Tests the complete system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Validates the software against user requirements and checks if it is ready for deployment.

**Lab Activity**:
1. **Hands-On Practice**: Write simple unit tests for a Python function using Pytest.
2. **Integration Testing**: Create a small project with multiple modules and write integration tests to ensure they work together.
3. **Functional Testing**: Develop functional tests for a web application using Selenium and Pytest.

### Overview of Testing Frameworks
**Description**: Testing frameworks provide tools and libraries to help automate the testing process. Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that is easy to use and supports various types of testing. It offers powerful features like fixtures, parameterized testing, and plugins.

**Lab Activity**:
1. **Framework Comparison**: Compare different Python testing frameworks (e.g., Pytest, unittest, nose) and discuss their pros and cons.
2. **Pytest Setup**: Install Pytest and set up a basic testing environment. Write and run a few simple tests to get familiar with the framework.
3. **Exploring Features**: Explore advanced features of Pytest such as fixtures and parameterized tests. Write tests that utilize these features.
